TextGame
========

Python text adventure game.


1. Put 'game.py', 'game_classes.py' and 'game.json' in the same folder.

2. Type 'python game.py' in a console window to play.
(Assuming of course you have a working Python installation.)

The game is fully functional, but I'm still adding content to the 'game.json' file.
